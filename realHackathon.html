          <h4>About</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Atypical is trying to change the way people
            learn how to code by changing what is learned and how it is learned.
            From our own experiences, we believe that one of the best places to go and
            learn code is a hackathon. We strongly believe that programming is best learned
            through trying and doing, not through reading books or listening to lectures. And
            a 24 hour event where you have to create a working project, with help from mentors
            and workshops, proves to be an effective way to gain valuable programming experience,
            while also making new friends and having fun. Atypical is launching a hackathon in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            We are catering our hackathon to students, allowing middle school students, high school students,
            and  college students.We are doing this to create a diverse environment, where both coders who have no experience
            and coders with experience can meet to create amazing technology, with workshops for the beginners, and representatives
            from local companies presenting internship postions or job oppportunities. Excited? Registration will be available soon. Sign up for email updates!</p>

              We are planning to locate this hackathon within walking distance of a  <br>
                 BART station to ensure easy  accessibility to students<br>
               in San Francisco and around the east bay. The event <br>
               will be free, as are most hackathons. The hackathon will start with an <br>
               invigorating keynote speech from local leaders in tech. After this, the <br>
               hackathon will begin with students creating teams and getting to work, high <br>
               school and college aged mentors helping them out, and workshops starting to <br>
               help new coders feel less intimidated.Projects will be due 24 hours from this <br>
               point. When it comes to hacking, you will be allowed to create a team with as <br>
               many as four people. The project you submit must have been made at the <br>
               hackathon; no previous projects will be taken into consideration. Your team is <br>
               allowed to create a project for any platform. We will even try and obtain <br>
               hardware for you to be able to do so. These workshops will include ones held by <br>
               Atypical to teach our Intro to Java through Android curriculum, a Node.js <br>
               workshop, and many others. Throughout the hackathon, there will be fun <br>
               activities, such as a dance contest and a multiperson videogame contest, and <br>
               enough food and caffeine to power you through your coding. The hackathon will <br>
               end with judging from local tech experts,where you will gain valuable insight <br>
               on how to better your project, and a closing ceremony, where the top projects <br>
               present their work. This hackathon should be the best opportunity for students <br>
               to socialiaze and help build technology for a better future. Ready? Schedule coming soon! <br>

          <p class="center-align light">
            Right now, we have 3 people dedicated to working on this hackathon, <br>
            but all of them go to Amador Valley High School. We want to spread <br>
            our idea to the rest of the Bay Area, particularily to middle schools,<br>
            high schools, and colleges in San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, and <br>
            Walnut Creek. For this reason, we would love if you could become a <br>
            campus ambassador for this hackathon. As a campus ambassador, you <br>
            would put up posters in your school, and help with advertising the <br>
            event to your friends. Besides the fact that this type of position <br>
            would look great on a CV or resume, this is an opportunity for you <br>
            to join the movement to create a new way to learn how to code. <br>
            Sounds like a cool gig, right?<br>

          <h4>Sponsors</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">
            Hackathons are expensive. Entertaining and feeding 500 people is never cheap,
            especially when people are working through the night, and will need food, water,
            and caffeine to stay awake. Ishaan Gulrajani, oranizer of the 2013 hackMIT, said
            in a <a href="https://medium.com/hackers-and-hacking/the-hackathon-budget-d636b5b2ed6c">Medium blog post</a>
            that it cost them $250,000 to cater for food, travel, and other necessities for their
            1000 attendees. The only way that such large coding events are possible is through sponsorships
            with companies. Atypical Hacks is in need of corporate sponsors. To be able to pay for food, prizes,
            power strips, and other necessary items, we are looking for roughly $60,000 of funding. By funding this hackathon,
            your company will be helping power an event that will help a wide range of students get excited about technology
            and create amazing projects. This is also a great opportunity for your company to debut products, especially for tech
            companies who create tools that help developers, such as APIs or database solutions. Becuase this event will have college students
            competing as well, the event will prove to be a great place for companies to fill internship positions for the summer or the fall.
            No matter how much money your company can provide to sponsor this event, there are definitely benefits seen for any amount.
